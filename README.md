# Multithreading Asynchronous Parallel Programming

Under the operating system, we have processes that run our applications. Under the process, an application runs. To run the code of an application the process will make use of a concept called Thread. Generally when we talk about thread, Thread is a lightweight process. A process has at least one thread which is commonly called the main thread that actually executes the application code. A single process can have multiple threads. All the threading-related classes are present in *System.Threading* namespace.
